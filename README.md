# My Coding Practice Repository

Started November 12, 2020

## Purpose Of This Repository

1. Promote daily logical thinking, start with pseudocode and a flow chart
2. Learn more about my favorite programming languages
3. Have fun and become less dependent on external solutions

## Goals

* Have a weekly theme for problems to solve
* Aim for 15 minutes a day, at least 5 days a week during work day
* Develop an efficient process to go from problem to solution. I was inspired
  by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7z4_0Keo5E), which lists
  these four steps to solve any coding problem.
  1. Define (articulate) the problem in human lauguage
  2. Iterate and translate
  3. Solve with a programming language
  4. Refactor the code, make it more simple, easier to read etc

## Languages To Work On

1. Bash
2. PowerShell
3. C
4. C#
5. Python
6. Javascript

## Problem Ideas Sources

* This website [edabit.com](https://edabit.com/challenges) has 10,000+ simple
  coding problems
